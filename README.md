# Nixie-tube-supply

This Nixie tube supply board was built as part of my Power Electronics course at KU Leuven - Campus GroupT in 2022-2023.

Design specifications for this board are 9V Input, and 170V Output (10 mA max). The MAX1771CPA+ step-up switching controller from MAXIM INTEGRATED was used for this application. All design choices and measurements can be found in the PDF document in the main branch.
